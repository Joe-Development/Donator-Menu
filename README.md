# Donator-Menu
A Free Donator Menu Developers can use in their servers

**What is this?**

This resource is a simple and free Donator Menu that developers/owners can use in their servers. 

**Config File**

The config file is located in the `config.lua`file. It is a lua file and contains all the config options. The config file is pretty self-explanatory, so I won't go into too much detail here.

**How to Install**

To install this resource, follow these steps:

1. Download the latest version of the resource from the releases page.
2. Extract the folder to your FXServer's `resources` folder.
3. Add the resource to your `server.cfg` file.
4. Restart your server.

**Note**

This resource is a simple and free resource, so it may not have all the features you want. If you want to request a feature, please open an issue on the GitHub page. I will try my best to add it as soon as possible.

also cant believe i have to explain this, but when putting aces into the menu your going to put a CUSTOM Ace example `donator.pack1` then in the server.cfg you can do `add_ace group.donatorpack1 donator.pack1 allow`
